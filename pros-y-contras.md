# Ideas to develop for the OOP-Project. 

This is going to be an analisis of pros and contras for several ideas we have in order to decide what would be the best project to develop for the Object Oriented Programing class. 

As of right now, we have three main ideas we want to work on: **Busca UN libro**, **Laundry App**, **Video Game**

## Pros and contras: 

### Busca UN libro

pros|contras
---|---
Its a very real project with solutions for real problems|we depend of several third parties to even start developing.
We are contributing to the UN library's system for the benefit of all its workers and users|We predent to work a very big data base. 
The mapping system its a good idea|A mapping tool its a completely different technology.

### Laundry App

pros|contras
---|---
An efficient system for shared-home people to organice their laundry.|It needs to be worked in Android studio.

### Video Game

pros|contras
---|---
Its very object oriented|We would be tackling rather a social problem which its not completely defined.
Gives a better and more dinamic experience for a user interested in learn about that problematic.|We need to work in a system that integrates both sides of the project: the social prolematic and the gameplay.
Video-game development its a booming industry and this project can help us get a first aproach.
